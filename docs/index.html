              <h3>Respect the table</h3>
              <p>
                The arm wrestling table is a valuable asset. It should be
                treated with respect and care. Keep it clean and tidy after use.
                Don't put random objects on it, like plants, beers and other
                stuff.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>com.west, 3rd floor only</h3>
              <p>
                Don't move the table anywhere outside the 3rd floor. After usage
                move it back to where it belongs.
              </p>
            </li>

              <h3>Prevent injuries</h3>
              <p>
                The arm wrestling table is designed to prevent injuries. As long
                as some basic rules are followed, the risk of injury is minimal.
